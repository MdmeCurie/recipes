The Chemist's Recipe for Chocolate Chip Cookies

The following recipe for chocolate chip cookies recently appeared in
Chemical & Engineering News (C&EN, Jun 19, 1995, p. 100). It was
attributed to Jeannene Ackerman of Witco Corp.

Ingredients:

1. 532.35 cm3 gluten
2. 4.9 cm3 NaHCO3
3. 4.9 cm3 refined halite
4. 236.6 cm3 partially hydrogenated tallow triglyceride
5. 177.45 cm3 crystalline C12H22O11
6. 177.45 cm3 unrefined C12H22O11
7. 4.9 cm3 methyl ether of protocatechuic aldehyde
8. Two calcium carbonate-encapsulated avian albumen-coated protein
9. 473.2 cm3 theobroma cacao
10. 236.6 cm3 de-encapsulated legume meats (sieve size #10)

To a 2-L jacketed round reactor vessel (reactor #1) with an overall
heat-transfer coefficient of about 100 Btu/F-ft2-hr add one, two, and
three with constant agitation.

In a second 2-L reactor vessel with a radial flow impeller operating
at 100 rpm add four, five, six, and seven until the mixture is
homogeneous.

To reactor #2 add eight followed by three equal portions of the
homogeneous mixture in reactor #1. Additionally, add nine and ten
slowly with constant agitation. Care must be taken at this point in
the reaction to control any temperature rise that may be the result of
an exothermic reaction.

Using a screw extrude attached to a #4 nodulizer place the mixture
piece-meal on a 316SS sheet (300 x 600 mm). Heat in a 460°K oven for a
period of time that is in agreement with Frank & Johnston's first
order rate expression (see JACOS, 21, 55), or until golden brown.

Once the reaction is complete, place the sheet on a 25°C heat-transfer
table allowing the product to come to equilibrium.

Please Don't Ask For "Normal" Measurements For This Recipe

This is a fairly standard recipe for chocolate-chip cookies using:
1. flour 2. baking powder 3. salt 4. butter/fat/lard 5. white sugar
6. brown sugar 7. vanilla essence 8. eggs 9. chocolate (chips
presumably) 10 peanuts
